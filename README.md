There are Linux drivers from FlashLabel for their thermal printers and label makers but they're distributed within scripts that intended to be run from root. Personally I would prefer not to run some untrusted script (even from legal distributor) on my machine so I created this repository where the original archives (extracted from the script) with their original checksums will be stored.
